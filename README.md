# Sales-Forecasting-Time-Series
Sales forecasting using Time Series Analysis (SARIMA and LSTM)
## Overview
This project uses **SARIMA** and **LSTM** models to predict sales for a retail store. The objective is to forecast demand and optimize inventory planning.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: For implementing the forecasting models
- **SARIMA**: Seasonal ARIMA model for forecasting
- **LSTM**: Deep learning-based model for time series forecasting
- **Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn**: Data manipulation and visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For data exploration, model building, and results presentation
